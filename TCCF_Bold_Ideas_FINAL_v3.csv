From a technical perspective, the solution relies on an innovative technology patented by OAPI, patent No. 18667. The technology is built on a mechanical assembly and structuring process for flexible plastic films, without melting, heat, or electricity. Unlike conventional mechanical, thermal, or chemical recycling processes, NRT’s technology leverages the intrinsic physical properties of flexible plastics—such as tensile strength, flexibility, and durability—to create a stable, reusable material. This makes it possible to recycle plastic films that are typically excluded from standard recycling streams due to their low thickness and thermal instability.

Core Insight

Plastic waste persists in African urban and coastal communities because collection systems, incentives, and behaviour change are disconnected. Most interventions focus on clean-ups or bans, but fail to create circular micro-systems that retain plastic value at community level.

Evidence & Research Basis

Studies show that over 80% of plastic leakage into oceans originates from land-based sources, particularly poorly managed urban waste systems.

Behavioural research indicates that people change disposal habits when waste has visible value (economic or social).

Community-based waste recovery models in low-income contexts perform better when youth leadership, incentives, and local reuse pathways are integrated.","This idea is bold because it challenges the dominant assumption that plastic waste solutions in Africa must be:

Our core insight is that Africa's plastic crisis is not a collection problem, but a transport problem. Informal pickers are efficient at scavenging but inefficient at transport (limited by trolley capacity). Our system decouples collection from transport, allowing pickers to focus on high-volume recovery while trucks handle the movement.


Technical/Scientific Validation:
The solution has undergone a formal Technology Audit with the University of Johannesburg’s Process, Energy & Environmental Technology Station (UJ-PEETS). The audit verified our technical specifications for:  

Asset Tracking Algorithms: The ability to digitally classify waste streams (separating PET, HDPE, and LDPE) at the point of collection.

  
Data Integration: Generating real-time ""Waste Information Reports"" for municipalities, filling the critical data gap in the National Waste Management Strategy regarding informal sector volumes.","The Assumption We Challenge:
We challenge the assumption that Africa needs ""more waste pickers"" or ""more recycling bins"" to fix the plastic crisis. We believe the collection network already exists (the 5,000+ informal pickers in Tembisa), but it is failing because it is disconnected from logistics.


The Change at Scale:
If LorryIt succeeds, we do not just clean up one township; we create a ""Virtual Waste Fleet"" for the entire continent. We prove that you don't need millions of dollars in government trucks to manage waste. You just need to digitally connect the informal ""trolley economy"" to th","Geography:
 We address the ""First-Mile"" logistics crisis in Tembisa (Ekurhuleni, South Africa), a high-density urban township where rigid municipal services struggle to access narrow streets.

Waste Stream:
 The specific problem is Post-Consumer Plastic (PET & HDPE). While valuable, these plastics are voluminous but lightweight (""air""), making them economically inefficient for informal waste pickers to transport manually using trolleys.

Actors Affected:
Informal Reclaimers (Waste Pickers): They","Informal Waste Workers & Urban Municipalities

Households: Have direct access platform for recycling that integrate recycling value chain to one digital channel with educational information on how to recycle plastic and other recyclable materials. 

Informal Waste Workers (Reclaimers): They benefit directly by overcoming the ""logistics barrier,"" allowing them to sell bulk volumes and increase thei", ,"The Solution :
LorryIt is a digital Smart waste ""First-Mile"" logistics platform that acts as the ""Uber for Plastic Waste."" We aggregate fragmented plastic supply from informal waste pickers and households in high-density townships (starting in Tembisa) and connect them to independent truck owners for bulk transport to recyclers.


How It Works:

Request:
 A waste picker with a full load of PET/HDPE uses the app to request a pickup instead of walking kilometers to a depot.

Material properties: Airline cups are typically made of polypropylene (PP) or polystyrene (PS). These polymers are thermoplastics, meaning they can be melted and reshaped multiple times without losing their fundamental properties.

We will use nanomaterials, such as MXene or microcapsules containing a liquid healing agent (monomer), within the polymer matrix of the plastic.

TRIGGERING:

When the plastic cracks or breaks, the damage ruptures the embedded capsules or exposes the nanomaterials to an external trigger, such as humidity, heat, light, or a chemical change.


AGENT ACTIVATION AND BONDING:

The released healing agent flows into the crack in the plastic bottle. The trigger activates the agent, causing a chemical reaction (polymerization) that effectively bonds the broken section in the plastic bottles back together.

RESTORATION:

The healing agent acts like a glue, solidifying to restore the plastic material's structural integrity and strength, sometimes to nearly its original level

We will use nanomaterials, such as MXene or microcapsules containing a liquid healing agent (monomer), within the polymer matrix of the plastic.

Our idea will help reduce plastic bottles pollution and disposal in the landfills and lakes, since the plastic bottles will be self healing if they cracked or breaks which makes them durable and last longer 

","
A single plastic bottle can take up to 450 years to break down — and even then, it never truly disappears. Instead, it shatters into microplastics that persist in the environment for generations.
